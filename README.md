# Simple file upload server (WITH QR CODE)

Simple file server with multipart/form-data and large file support

### Install 
add the bash script to your $PATH

### params are not passed! (the QR hack is just that, a hack)
- I needed something quick and easy
- having files all go to the same directory (and not current dir) is imo a nice thing / feature
- I haven't needed any of the flags / arguments
